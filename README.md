# neural-machine-translation-in-linear-time
The main code is contained in the notebooks, which implement attempts for the character prediction task, the machine translation task, BLEU evaluation and Beam Search.
The other code files mainly contain our first attempts at implementing the network and do not contain completely up to date code.
# Notebooks
  * bleu_eval_* implements bleu evaluation of our model
  * bytenet_26062024 implements a beam search alongside the ByteNet
  * bytenet_prediction implements our attempt at the character prediction task
  * bytenet_translation implements our attempt at the translation task
